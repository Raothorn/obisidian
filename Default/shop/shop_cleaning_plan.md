# Shop cleaning plan

## Definitions
* **Tier 0 Container**: The shop itself
* **Tier 1 Container**: A shelf or large toolbox, or a work area such as a workbench or large tool.
* **Tier 2 Container**: An *unlidded*, *unstacked*, and *clearly labelled* bin, box, bucket, or pegboard. A clearly labelled and demarcated segment of shelf (or floor under the shelf) can also be a T2 container.

## Phase 1: Declutter

A space is decluttered when all of the following are true:

* Throw out as much as possible
* Nothing except for T1 containers touch the ground.
* All T1 containers are in the T0 container, and all T2 containers are in a T1 container.
