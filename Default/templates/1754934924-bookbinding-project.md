## Preparing materials
- [ ] Make sure that your pages are all the same size.
- [ ] Create endpapers

## Creating text block
During this process, make sure to keep the signatures in the same orientation.
- [ ] Fold pages into signatures
- [ ] Pierce holes
- [ ] Sew onto tapes, including endpapers

## Rounding and backing
- [ ] Glue spine, not including tapes
- [ ] When spine is dry to the touch but not fully cured, trim the foreedge
- [ ] Round the book. Go slowly and turn over frequently.
- [ ] Trim the head and tail
- [ ] Mark the shoulders at (1.5 * board thickness)
- [ ] Back the shoulders to 90 degrees at the mark
- [ ] Set the spine by gluing again, this time on the tapes.

## Lacing on boards
- [ ] Fray out the tapes to make slips
- [ ] Cut boards to height (height of textblock + 3mm * 2). Don't worry about width. Mark front and back boards and orientation.
- [ ] Pierce holes at 8mm. On the other side, pierce holes at 16mm at a 45 degree angle toward the tail. 
- [ ] Cut recesses at the front from the spine edge to the 8mm holes. Cut a canal between the 8mm and 16mm holes on the back.
- [ ] Glue (using mix) the slips into the back recesses. Put glue in the holes and hammer down the slips.
- [ ] Set the squares by gluing into the front recesses.
- [ ] Cut the foreedge squares to length (4mm past edge of textblock).

## Lining the spine 
- [ ] Glue ribbon bookmark on the head side of the spine.
- [ ] Glue a thin cloth on the spine.
- [ ] Sew on 2-color endbands.
- [ ] Glue on cardstock insets between to bring the spine close to flush.
- [ ] Glue on another layer of paper to flatten out.
- [ ] Glue on craft paper 3 fold hollow.
- [ ] Trim all the spine lining so it isn't sticking out. Slit the hollow 20mm on each side.

## Covering the spine and corners in leather
- [ ] Mark a line a quarter of the distance from the shoulder to the foreedge on each board
- [ ] Using paper template with shoulder joint creased, cut leather to this width.
- [ ] In the other direction, cut the leather to the height of the book + 30cm
- [ ] Using the template, mark up the leather as to where the spine and boards will go
- [ ] Pare the turn-ins, especially at the headcap and shoulders.
- [ ] Dampen the grain side of the leather, and then apply several layers of wheat flour paste to the hair side of the spine area, scraping off each time.
- [ ] Shape the leather to the spine. Crease in the shoulders. 
- [ ] Paste and scrape the side flaps and paste them down to the boards. Mark a line in the leather where the pencil line on the boards was.
- [ ] Paste down the turn-ins. Form the headcaps and shape the ears.
- [ ] On the corners of the boards, mark triangles with sidelengths equal to the quarter distance measured before.
- [ ] Using template, cut leather to this size + 15mm for turn-ins
- [ ] Paste down these corners and turn in. Pleat the corners with bone folder and hammer and more paste if necessary.
- [ ] Wait 24 hours to dry.

## Covering in cloth
- [ ] Measure and cut out a cloth inset to cover the remaining area of the boards. Don't forget turn-ins.
- [ ] Paste this down
- [ ] Paste the turn-ins.
- [ ] Trim the turn-ins of both the leather and cloth to be an even width.
- [ ] Inset the empty board area with card stock

## Pasting down
- [ ] Trim the endpaper to width. Expect it to expand ~1mm during pasting.
- [ ] Paste down and hope for the best
