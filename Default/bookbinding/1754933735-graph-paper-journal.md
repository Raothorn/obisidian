# Graph Paper Journal
## Preparing materials
- [x] Make sure that your pages are all the same size.
* Mistake: I did not do this
- [x] Create endpapers

## Creating text block
During this process, make sure to keep the signatures in the same orientation.
- [x] Fold pages into signatures
- [x] Pierce holes
* Mistake: I failed to keep them in the same orientation, so I didn't have a square edge to work with when trimming
- [x] Sew onto tapes, including endpapers
* Mistake: I tipped on the endpapers rather than sewing

## Rounding and backing
- [x] Glue spine, not including tapes
- [x] When spine is dry to the touch but not fully cured, trim the foreedge
* I trimmed after backing instead of before
- [x] Round the book. Go slowly and turn over frequently.
- [x] Trim the head and tail
- [x] Mark the shoulders at (1.5 * board thickness)
* Mistake: I didn't mark the shoulders so they are much too wide
- [x] Back the shoulders to 90 degrees at the mark
- [x] Set the spine by gluing again, this time on the tapes.

## Lacing on boards
- [x] Fray out the tapes to make slips
- [x] Cut boards to height (height of textblock + 3mm * 2). Don't worry about width. Mark front and back boards and orientation.
- [x] Pierce holes at 8mm. On the other side, pierce holes at 16mm at a 45 degree angle toward the tail. 
- [x] Cut recesses at the front from the spine edge to the 8mm holes. Cut a canal between the 8mm and 16mm holes on the back.
- [x] Glue (using mix) the slips into the back recesses. Put glue in the holes and hammer down the slips.
- [x] Set the squares by gluing into the front recesses.
- [x] Cut the foreedge squares to length (4mm past edge of textblock).
* Mistake: I wasn't careful when measuring here

	## Lining the spine 
- [~] Glue ribbon bookmark on the head side of the spine.
- [x] Glue a thin cloth on the spine.
- [x] Sew on 2-color endbands.
* I probably should have used slightly thicker thread. I used a piece of a handle from a brown paper bag for the core and it worked well
- [x] Glue on cardstock insets between to bring the spine close to flush.
- [x] Glue on another layer of paper to flatten out.
- [x] Glue on craft paper 3 fold hollow.
- [ ] Trim all the spine lining so it isn't sticking out. Slit the hollow 20mm on each side.

## Covering the spine and corners in leather
- [ ] Mark a line a quarter of the distance from the shoulder to the foreedge on each board
- [ ] Using paper template with shoulder joint creased, cut leather to this width.
- [ ] In the other direction, cut the leather to the height of the book + 30cm
- [ ] Using the template, mark up the leather as to where the spine and boards will go
- [ ] Pare the turn-ins, especially at the headcap and shoulders.
- [ ] Dampen the grain side of the leather, and then apply several layers of wheat flour paste to the hair side of the spine area, scraping off each time.
- [ ] Shape the leather to the spine. Crease in the shoulders. 
- [ ] Paste and scrape the side flaps and paste them down to the boards. Mark a line in the leather where the pencil line on the boards was.
- [ ] Paste down the turn-ins. Form the headcaps and shape the ears.
- [ ] On the corners of the boards, mark triangles with sidelengths equal to the quarter distance measured before.
- [ ] Using template, cut leather to this size + 15mm for turn-ins
- [ ] Paste down these corners and turn in. Pleat the corners with bone folder and hammer and more paste if necessary.
- [ ] Wait 24 hours to dry.

## Covering in cloth
- [ ] Measure and cut out a cloth inset to cover the remaining area of the boards. Don't forget turn-ins.
- [ ] Paste this down
- [ ] Paste the turn-ins.
- [ ] Trim the turn-ins of both the leather and cloth to be an even width.
- [ ] Inset the empty board area with card stock

## Pasting down
- [ ] Trim the endpaper to width. Expect it to expand ~1mm during pasting.
- [ ] Paste down and hope for the best
